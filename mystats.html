            I had completed my graduation in the year 2020.
            I had traveled to Vijayawada, Hyderbad, chennai, balglore, goa, pondicherry.
            I had felt different experience in the above while visting cities the major difference are
            food, public transpotaion and resturants.

        <h1>Biriyani</h1>
        <p>
            Biriyani is my favourite foods of all. If i vist different cities first dish i ordered for my lunch is 
            biriyani. Majorly i like to eat biriyani in Hyderbad with compare of other and because of recpies.
            i felt biriyani in Hyderbad are much delicious a than other.
